🔍 Project Origin & Learning Purpose

This project is based on an existing Django Notes application originally created by the TrainWithShubham (TWS) community.

The core application idea and logic were referenced for learning purposes.
My independent contribution and focus was on:

Dockerizing the Django application

Creating a multi-container architecture using Docker Compose

Running Django, MySQL, and Nginx in separate containers

Configuring Nginx as a reverse proxy

Understanding container networking, volumes, and service communication

🎯 The purpose of this project is learning DevOps and containerization concepts using a real application, not claiming ownership of the original app logic.

🔧 What I Implemented Independently
